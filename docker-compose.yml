  # Due to NAT issues the asterisk container is on host network instead of default bridge network
  # This means asterisk is essentially running on the docker host's network as opposed to the docker bridge network
  # so port forwarding is not needed but it means asterisk is exposed and not isolated (network-wise) in same way as the
  # other containers
